<strong>Module description</strong>
</p>
<p>
The module will explore and investigate the fundamental theories and practices of computing and then gradually explore the trends and current developments in the field of cyber security. The module introduces the historical, architectural and practical perspectives of the computer science discipline, also enables the learners to get engage, experience and envision the current, as well as the future, developments in cyber security. This involves equipping students with the practical skills required to be able to analyse an information system problem, design and implement a solution using suitable programming languages. The module is designed not only to equip the students with an understanding of concepts and knowledge, but also to make the learners be aware of the ethical and professional responsibilities of the cyber security professional.
